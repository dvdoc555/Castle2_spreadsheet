Hello, 

I just got around to looking at the results of the Castle challenge you posted last week, and I did not get the same results as you when I ran the data.  Here is an Excel spreadsheet with my results.  

Column A-J is the submissions with the comments omitted.
K-U is a computation of raw points.

The entries are sorted by winning percentage.  If you change the number in cell “AK1”, columns W-AF will compute the point totals for the row number referenced in AK1.  AH and AI computer whether the result was a win or a tie.  (each entry, of course “ties” itself, so subtract 1 for the total number of ties)  I made a quick macro to compute columns AJ and AK and lost them in the saving of the workbook.  

I came in 28th place.
